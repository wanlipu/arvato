# Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Capstone Project
This is part of Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Program, and this repository is meant to document my progress towards Capstone Project completion.

## Project Structure
Data Files:
- `./data/Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv`
- `./data/Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv`

In addition to the data files, the project workspace includes five files:

- `DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx` contains Attribute description for the four main data files.
- `DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx` Attribute value explanation for each attribute, and it could help for data preprocessing steps.
- `Project_final_report.docx`.
- `README.md` provides instructions on the project
